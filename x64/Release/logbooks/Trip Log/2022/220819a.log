========================================
<ul>
	<li>Old backpanel removed, new installed. PC is separate from the backpanel because it was easier to move that way.&nbsp;I have the old flash drive right now</li>
	<li>Did PLC wiring and some AC/DC wiring. Some confusion on where the saw guide up/down wires went. Hoping to find out tomorrow</li>
	<li>Juwan installed the new keyboard, did the wiring for the scanner cabinet, and directed me through most of it/answered a lot of my questions</li>
	<li>The new monitor is installed but needs to be wired. Gave the sawyers some trouble to drill holes through the old door</li>
	<li>Planning to power on, get through testing the cabinet,&nbsp;and start calibrating tomorrow</li>
</ul>
