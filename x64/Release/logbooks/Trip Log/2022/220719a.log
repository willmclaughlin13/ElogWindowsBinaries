	<li>Added auto slab belt to the program</li>
	<li>Removed manual slab attached from the operator tracking section in pant_sub() since it is not working and is no longer used</li>

========================================
<ul>
	<li>When we got there, I noticed Pvalues wasn&#39;t running.&nbsp; I restarted the system, and it was working fine after words.</li>
	<li>We received the&nbsp;buttons from the shop and installed them (Dispatch Auto, Slab Drop Auto, Trimmer).</li>
	<li>I noticed an issue with the dispatch.&nbsp; I saw a flitch that was supposed to go to the edger go out to the green chain and the following flitch went to the edger.&nbsp; I think with the 5/1000 second delay for the route waiting transfer, the next route snuck in.&nbsp; I modified the PLC to prevent this from happening.</li>
	<li>I updated their spare PLC CPU with the changes I made to the PLC program.</li>
	<li>Kaitlin and I measured the opening faces on several flitches, and they were good.</li>
</ul>

<p>7/19</p>

<ul>
	<li>Missing sticker with the after hours number</li>
	<li>PValues crashed at some point in the morning before we arrived and the first 100 or so logs weren&#39;t tracked</li>
	<li>Measured flitches to check if the opening face was accurate</li>
	<li>Daniel put in the new buttons and fixed the bug in the PLC program that was causing routing issues</li>
</ul>
