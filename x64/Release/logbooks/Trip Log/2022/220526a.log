<ul>
	<li>Terminated the DC inputs.</li>
	<li>Larry (electrician) mentioned that the outfeed belt motor is a VFD.&nbsp; Their old outfeed rollcase was powered by a chain connecteed to the edger.
	<ul>
		<li>I told Larry I need 8 wires for the VFD ran from the VFD to the setworks cabinet.</li>
		<li>I updated the drawings and terminated the VFD control and feedback wires in the Setworks cabinet.</li>
		<li>I terminated the VFD control and feeback wires on the VFD.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Phillip requested that the machine have 4 speeds.
	<ul>
		<li>I called Sam and informed him of the change.</li>
		<li>At the hotel, I relized that the increase in the number of speeds, it effects the press roll timing as well.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Worked on terminating the AC output wiring.</li>
	<li>Phillip inquired on the positioning of the scan beam.&nbsp; We looked at it and he said that it needs to scan at least 48&quot;.&nbsp; I told him that he should move the scan beam 5&quot; away from the edger to be able to scan 48&quot;.</li>
	<li>At the hotel that evening, I took a home Covid 19 test and tested positive.</li>
</ul>
