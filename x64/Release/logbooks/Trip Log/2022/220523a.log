	<li>Added Slab Drop Config to Setworks and set it up&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Adjusted the cant pan delay

		<li>It was still not the way the operator wanted it.&nbsp; I looked code and found their old Job # had a line of code to toggle off the cant pins on New Log.&nbsp; I replaced their old job number with their new and recompiled the software.&nbsp; After installing the new software and changing the cant pins back to just a spare, it work the way the operator wanted it to.</li>
