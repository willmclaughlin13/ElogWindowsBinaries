========================================
<ul>
	<li>Attempted to power on: voltages in the cabinet looked okay</li>
	<li>PC unable to boot, stuck in BIOS. No spare was ever shipped: placed on backorder according to the mill, but must have been marked complete back at Lewis without it ever being shipped.</li>
	<li>Will troubleshooting the PC for us. Best guess is that the SSD is bad and we need to buy a temporary external drive until we can get a new PC shipped.</li>
	<li>Still need to space out the lasers on the scan bar so they&#39;re more evenly spaced out.</li>
</ul>
