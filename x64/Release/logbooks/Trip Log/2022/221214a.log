========================================
<ul>
	<li>We got there and observed them running.&nbsp; Solutions and edgings looked good.&nbsp; While observing the edgings, a couple of boards fell off of the outfeed belt.</li>
	<li>At their first break, Sam wanted to change the PLC timing for reading and writing to the RMC.&nbsp; During this time, I created a flash drive for the optimizer and ran it from it.
	<ul>
		<li>After break, we found that the optimizer was getting multiple next scan packets.&nbsp; Sam made some changes to try to fix it, but it did not work.&nbsp; He reverted the PLC code back to a working version from this morning.</li>
		<li>The optimizer was having communication problems with RMC, so I switched the program back to running off of the hard drive and removed our wireless router connected the PLC network.&nbsp; After that, we had no more issues.</li>
	</ul>

	<li>We left the mill around 1:30pm.</li>
