========================================
<ul>
	<li>The edger feedworks does not have a pulse encoder (high speed), but it has a shaft encoder.&nbsp; I called Laurie and requested the following be sent overnight.
	<ul>
		<li>Q4 modules for the RMC</li>
		<li>150&#39; encoder cable</li>
		<li>12&#39; of 18awg wires - 16 colors (call Chris and requested these)</li>
		<li>12 each - CAT 5e cable connectors</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Sam removed the high speed encoder input module from the PLC.
	<ul>
		<li>Removing the module cause the Control Power PLC input to come on when MCR is off and turn off in the PLC when the MCR was on.
		<ul>
			<li>Found that when we removed the high speed encoder, we cause the DC ground for part of the back panel to not be connected to power supply DC ground.
			<ul>
				<li>We temporarly patch it to drain until we get the 12&#39; 18awg white wire from Lewis.</li>
