========================================
<ul>
	<li>The board/cant sensors acted up again.&nbsp; They were coming on randomly.
	<ul>
		<li>We did not connect the shield of the cable to ground, so we grounded the cable between the optimizer cabinet and the junction box.&nbsp; We also move some AC wires in the cabinet so they were not on top of the input wires going to the PLC from the terminal blocks.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>I tacked the gang feed rolls and they were running slower than we thought they were.&nbsp; I increased the frequency from 30 hrz. to 60 hrz and tacked the gang feed rolls close to 100 ft/minute.</li>
	<li>We used the GoPro to set the gang machine pressrolls.</li>
	<li>After discussions about the board side pressrolls with Mill between John, Chuck&nbsp;Boaz, &amp; Mac, the mill said they had some used board side machine pressrolls and they would install them that evening.&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>It was then discovered that Corley had shipped 2 board side machine pressrolls with the edger infeed deck.</li>
		<li>Corley found a infeed pressroll for the board side that would work on the edger.&nbsp; Big John went to Corley, picked it up, and delivered it to the mill.</li>
		<li>The mill completed installing all 3 board side pressrolls by the time we left around 7:45pm.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The VFDs for the left and right decks arrived.
	<ul>
		<li>I helped Mac install them.</li>
		<li>We did not setup the parameters on the VFDs or test them.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>We requested the mill adjust the turns on the left deck&#39;s pass turn so that the bottom lip is lower.&nbsp; Boards and cants are occasionally getting hung up on them (they are a little higher then the gang skew chains).</li>
	<li>I helped Sam with the PLC code for the Next Scan Packet require the positioning chains to be stopped before sending the next scan packet.&nbsp; This is to fix the occasional&nbsp; issue that caused the flitch to be positioned about 2-3&quot; off center of solution.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
