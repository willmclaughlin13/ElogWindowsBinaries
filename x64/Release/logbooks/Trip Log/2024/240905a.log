<ul>
	<li>Improved the carriage reference error getting it under 2&quot; each time (Sam changed how the PLC reads from the RMC)</li>
	<li>Fixed AC output wiring</li>
	<li>Swapped TM 8 and TM 4 in the hot swap box. I will reland these wires so the labels match</li>
	<li>Swapped the probe on the ASG to the R-series. Sam tried the auto-cal but didn&#39;t have much luck</li>
	<li>Calibrated the scanners</li>
	<li>Scanned and cut a log. Opening face was way too small. Hard to tell if it&#39;s the slabber or the optimizer. Tomorrow we&#39;ll try opening withouth the slabber hopefully, otherwise we could measure that first board</li>

<ul>
	<li>Struggling with the optimizer crashing sometimes when solutioning. I think we&#39;re writing outside of an array and clobbering all the proceeding memory until it goes outside of the allowed memory and faults. It&#39;s sporadic and hard to reproduce. Even more difficult to find the problem since it tends to fault far away from the actual problem.</li>
	<li>Slab attached is now working sometimes. We found the PLC&#39;s max slab attached was set to 0&quot;. I&#39;m going to add some menus to show read-only values to help prevent this in the future. The optimizer could change these values in the future.</li>
	<li>Spent a lot of time trying to scan and solution an already-cut log after the optimizer crashed. This is something RS2 struggles with, so no surprise RS3 has a hard time as well.</li>
	<li>The slabber&#39;s position from the PC is weird. Need to look into that and figure out why it&#39;s not going to the correct position</li>

========================================
<ul>
	<li>Overhead Positioning sensors
	<ul>
		<li>Ran and terminated&nbsp;the cables from sensors (SR1, SR2, &amp; SL1) to the junction box.&nbsp; Waiting for the parts ordered from Lewis to arrive (UPS did not deliver them today).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Verified that the AC &amp; DC power was not shorted out prior turning the system on (continuity checks).</li>
	<li>Powered on the system.
	<ul>
		<li>The PC took several minutes to start up on first power on.</li>
		<li>The system powered on without any issues.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Save a copy of the PLC, RMC, &amp; Cmore as powered on.</li>
	<li>Installed the new PLC, RMC, &amp; Cmore programs that Jon had given me.
	<ul>
		<li>The analog card in the Remote PLC rack was a different model than was in the PLC configuration and was causing the PLC to fault out.&nbsp; I updated the PLC configuration in the program to fix the issue.</li>
		<li>Used Jon&#39;s instructions and updated the HMI parameters with the values from the system as it had shipped from Corley.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Tested the Skew chains, Infeed rolls, Edger Feed rolls, Left Deck, Right Deck, Scanners, Saw Shift, &amp; the Edger Transfer Chains.
	<ul>
		<li>Left &amp; Right decks were running backwards, so the electricians corrected it and now they move in the correct direction.</li>
		<li>The scan frame was hard to move.&nbsp; There was a lot of rust on the rails and chains.&nbsp; I had to free it up by hand to get it to work.</li>
		<li>The saw shift would not move more than a couple of inches.&nbsp; Raymond had to beat on the collars to break them free of the rust.&nbsp; He then cleaned the arbor and now they move freely.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>I tested the Saw Lasers, and they would not turn on.
	<ul>
		<li>I found that the PLC code had them landed on output 606 when it should be 609.&nbsp; Moved it from 606 to 609 in the PLC code and that fixed the issue.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>We went to test the air&nbsp;solenoids valves and found one of the values had an issue.&nbsp; By the time they got it fixed, I was working on tuning the scan frame movement.</li>
	<li>I tuned the scan frame movement in the RMC.&nbsp; I was able to get a 49&quot; movement down to about 1.75 seconds.
	<ul>
		<li>I had Raymond spray the rails &amp; chains with lube to help free them from the rust.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>I tuned the skew chains in the RMC.&nbsp; I was able to tune them to move 12&quot; in about 0.75 seconds.</li>
	<li>I went to close the MCC cabinet door and the disconnect shaft was out of alignment with the disconnect handle (not fabbed correctly at the shop) and it broke the handle.&nbsp; I sent a text to Paul and told him we would need a new handle.</li>
</ul>
