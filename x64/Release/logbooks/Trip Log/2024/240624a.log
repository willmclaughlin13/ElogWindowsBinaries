========================================
<ul>
	<li>When I arrived at the mill they had started removing the wiring to the carriage.</li>
	<li>I identified and labeled wires that might need to be reused.</li>
	<li>I removed what I could from the RS1 back panel to lighten it.</li>
	<li>I removed the RS1 back panel and we installed the new RS2 back panel.</li>
	<li>I wired in the door switch, fan, and lights.&nbsp; I hooked up the Elo &amp;&nbsp;keyboard.</li>
	<li>Spent the last half of the day waiting for the mill to install the Quick Swap cabinet and land cables/wires.</li>
