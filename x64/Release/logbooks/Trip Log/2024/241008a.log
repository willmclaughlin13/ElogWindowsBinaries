========================================
<ul>
	<li>The trimmer was still not ready.</li>
	<li>Me &amp; Jon helped Berry @ Corley terminate wires in the trimmer MCC cabinet.</li>
	<li>The electrician came and said that the vibrating conveyor for the edger was not starting at times.
	<ul>
		<li>After investigating, it was a mechanical problem.&nbsp; It would bind in the starting position.</li>
		<li>While trouble shooting the issue, the motor starter overheated.&nbsp; The mill had a spare, so Berry replaced it.&nbsp; Then after that we blew to PLC output fuse for it and 2 other motor starters.&nbsp; Not sure what happened, but the other 2 motor starters appear to be fused in the open position.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Installed the version of Productivity 2000 software that we are using for the PLC on the edger brick.</li>
</ul>
