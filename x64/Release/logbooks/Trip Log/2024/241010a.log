<ul>
	<li>Waiste vibrating&nbsp;conveyor would not start when we started the machine up.
	<ul>
		<li>The vibrating conveyor physically binds at time when trying to start it.&nbsp; They have to use the disconnect switch to bump it quickly a couple of times in order to start it when this happens.</li>
	</ul>
