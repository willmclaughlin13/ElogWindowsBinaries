========================================
<ul>
	<li>Fixed bug with the reports causing it to fail to connect to the database when it should have succeeded.</li>
	<li>Moved cant kickers back where they should have been and they are magically working correctly. Spare 2 wasn&#39;t working because it was in use by the slab belt in the setworks cabinet. I was confused by the drawings for the spare 2 output in the remote cabinet showing nothing connected.</li>
	<li>Cleaned up the cabinets</li>
	<li>Applied our stickers to their saw cab</li>
	<li>Measured the cants from yesterday which had mixed results. I&#39;ll measure again when we run tomorrow.</li>
	<li>As I&#39;m writing this I notice I&#39;m missing the raceway cover over the PC. I&#39;ll put that on tomorrow.</li>
</ul>

				<li>Gave up on getting the cant kickers moving and made it a spare output. Spare 2 didn&#39;t seem to work either, so I put it on spare 4</li>
				<li>Calibrated the scanners</li>
				<li>Setup the shifts and species settings</li>
				<li>Calibrated the auto saw guide</li>
				<li>Set virtual pantograph</li>
				<li>Set slab drop open and close</li>
				<li>Ran 3 logs and started training Eric the sawyer who&#39;s picking it up quickly</li>
				<li>The auto saw guide has an unusual problem: on new logs, it drops all the way down, then goes back up to target, and overshoots, causing it to oscillate back and forth in big 6&quot; sweeps. I increased the tolerance from 1&quot; to 1.5&quot; which improved it. I might increase it more, but it&#39;s certainly bizarre. These old sawyers have enough trouble trusting auto features without this kind of behavior</li>

							<li>Advised millwrights on where to mount the photo eye. My suggestion which they went with was to point the photoeye that&#39;s mounted on the carriage straight down looking for a 12&quot; flag they made bolted to the floor next to the carriage rail. Initially the eye couldn&#39;t see the flag since it was black steel. They painted it red which worked well</li>
							<li>Finished wiring both the setworks and remote cabinet (which were mounted side-by-side in the cab)</li>
							<li>Spaced out the scan heads according to the revised drawings</li>
							<li>Plugged in all scan heads</li>
							<li>Powered on cabinets</li>
							<li>Tested carriage AC. All working well except the cant kicker. Not sure what was wrong, but got it fixed after trying a lot of things. I think updating to the latest master did the trick??</li>
							<li>Struggled with the saw guide for a little while before Daniel helped me realize we don&#39;t allow the saw guide to move beyond limits without any error message. ASG was not connected to a tempo yet</li>
							<li>Tested encoder, had to change direction</li>
							<li>Tested reference, working properly</li>
							<li>Knees wouldn&#39;t move at all. I had Eric the sawyer hold down limit override (active runaways) while I went out to check on the carriage. 30 seconds later all knees suddenly jumped. They&#39;d been down for a long time, maybe they were seized up? After that everything was fine with knees.</li>
							<li>Calibrated knees</li>
							<li>Measured carriage and lasers and carriage reference position</li>
							<li>Replaced console lables</li>
