========================================
<ul>
	<li>Not a lot of work done on the edger today.&nbsp; We were still waiting on the mill to finish up on the trimmer.</li>
	<li>We tested to edger transfer logic and got an initial timing of 1.5 seconds delay to begin the transfer process.</li>
	<li>Back at the shop I started re-grouping the parameters on the Model Parameters screen.&nbsp; I finished and updated their system with the new software.</li>
	<li>Helped out with the trimmer.&nbsp; Tracked down and fixed a power issue with the remote box for the trimmer lasers.</li>
</ul>

<p>FYI - They plan on running the head rig tomorrow morning to feed us flitches.&nbsp; The trimmer won&#39;t be ready for it, but they will stockpile edged board if they need to.</p>
