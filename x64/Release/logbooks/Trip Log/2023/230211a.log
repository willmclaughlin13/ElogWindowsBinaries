========================================
<p>Showed up on site to find the mill didn&#39;t have the upgrade parts and expected I would be bringing them. Discussed it with Marv who also didn&#39;t know I was expected to bring the parts and agreed to try to tune their existing hardware and reschedule the upgrade. After 30 minutes of failing to tune the linebar axis, I moved on to the saw to find it wouldn&#39;t move at all. Tried the jog box and could feel the valve opening and closing. Traced it back to a brand new hydraulic pump that Jeff didn&#39;t know they installed yesterday that was only producing 100PSI. Tried to increase the pressure but we didn&#39;t know what we were doing and gave up. Complete failure of planning and general embarassment for Lewis Controls.</p>
