========================================
<p>Joined Chris on the second day of the install. When I got there, the scanners were installed and measurements done. Taught the sawyer how to operate the machine while scanning and optimizing. Experimented with different features to get them cutting the way they wanted. Setup reports and began setting up email, waiting to hear back from their IT to configure the mail server.</p>
