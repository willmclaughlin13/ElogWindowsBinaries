========================================
<p>Fri, Mar 10, 2023.<br />
- HDMI cable sent to mill was the wrong length: sent 20 ft, needed to be 50 ft or more.<br />
- The existence of the scanner cabinet was not communicated well to Parker before installation.<br />
- Old log deck spares no longer being used in system. Tied to foot pedal in sawyer&#39;s cab.<br />
- Old back panel was removed.<br />
- Mill putting up scanner cable housing and IF cabinet.<br />
- Left logs on rail to cut for testing later.</p>

<p>Sat, Mar 11, 2023.<br />
- Wiring in new backpanel.<br />
- Missing saw guide temposonic: found it and wired it back in.<br />
- Ethernet ports on PC were backwards again.<br />
- Laser switches needed to be rewired and changed in drawings. The outside switch was removed entirely.<br />
- Basil had to add turner up to the PLC program since it was missing.<br />
- Rewired the spare outputs going from the PLC out to the junction box.<br />
- Installed help files.</p>

<p>Sun, Mar 12, 2023.<br />
- Power board went bad and needed to be replaced.<br />
- Moved heads because the log loader prongs blocked the lasers.<br />
- Face plates extended whenever the system started. Basil made an adjustment for that.<br />
- Saw deviation sensors were not showing up - wires were pulled out by accident.<br />
- Needed to redo system values because console mapping caused crashes.</p>

<p>Mon, Mar 13, 2023.<br />
- Log loader input wasn&#39;t in console mapping and needed to be reset.<br />
- Found that the saw deviation sensors needed to be reset.<br />
- Adjusted the slab drop encoder values.<br />
- Found timber bind was on by accident, removed it from software.<br />
- Redid the scanner calibration.<br />
- Turned on prepositioning to move back a foot before going back past the saw.<br />
- Cleaned up cabinet since there weren&#39;t any changes left to make.<br />
- Set delays to the minimum to undog faster, as requested.<br />
- Fixed the label on the knee calibration button on the console.<br />
- Had the position of the saw deviation sensors adjusted so they would give better readings.</p>

<p>Tue, Mar 14, 2023.<br />
- Set prespot to only work on mill end and tested the change.<br />
- There seems to be an issue with the scan set disable area being inconsistent.<br />
- Also, lengths seem to be inconsistently measured by the scanners. Missing inches from measurement.<br />
