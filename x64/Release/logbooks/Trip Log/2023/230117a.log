========================================
<p>Between yesterday and today all I did was answer a couple questions and took down the new gradient values on these tempos that were accidentally left in the cylinders we shipped. Tomorrow I&#39;ll have to have them swap those tempos and mail them back to us. Long hours standing and waiting for the work to be done</p>
