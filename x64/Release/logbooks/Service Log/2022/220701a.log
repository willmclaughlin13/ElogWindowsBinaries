<p>Samuel called and asked if I could help them calibrate their scanners because the edger was leave more wane on one side.&nbsp; I helped them calibrate the scanners and I changed&nbsp;their Board Position Offset from -0.300&quot; to 0.000.&nbsp; They cut a few flitches and they were happy with it.</p>

========================================
<p>Samuel called back.&nbsp; The widths of the cut boards don&#39;t match the widths shown in the optimizer.&nbsp; I helped them calibrate their saws, but they weren&#39;t they got out of calibration after the moved the saws.&nbsp; I had them find the gradient value of the saw tempo.&nbsp; I had to set the gradient value in the RMC because I did not find a screen to do that in the HMI for the saws.&nbsp; After setting the gradient value (8.9482), the saws stayed in calibration&nbsp;after a move.&nbsp; Samuel also asked me to take a look at why the edger would go into reverse on its own.&nbsp; When I looked at the PLC, I saw the right joystick input voltage fluctuating and that was what was causing it to go into reverse.</p>
