========================================
<p>Tim sent me a text message that the edger was still acting up.&nbsp; After some trouble shooting, I found that the system was waiting for the piece to enter the edger.&nbsp; Per Tim when the problem happens, the board has not been position on the table, but the system thinks it had been.&nbsp; I got on their RMC and found that when the pins were moving to position the board, PIN 1 looses it&#39;s temposonic reading and stops the pins.&nbsp; Tim is going to look into it and will call back if he needs further assistance.</p>

<p>Tim sent me a text stating that they changed the probe and it is working so far.</p>

<p>I updated Pin 1&#39;s gradient value at the end of Day Shift.&nbsp; - Note: The HMI screen does not work for updating their gradient values.</p>
