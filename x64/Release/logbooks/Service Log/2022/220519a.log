<ul>
	<li>Heath called with his new encoder. Wasn&rsquo;t using the power adapter at first. The pantograph switch was disabled. Got everything dialed in and calibrated, big -99&rdquo; and +99&rdquo; errors as well as perfect references. Daniel helped me figure out it was referencing multiple times. I had him watch the prox. Switch and he was able to see it flicker when the sensor passed between the carriage and the encoder wheel. I suggested he cover that gap and never heard back from him. Checked encoder errors this morning and it&rsquo;s looking great now</li>

<p>Got some more info from the mill, it&#39;s not faulting, just the roll case stops working. Sam helped me look through the PLC and we&#39;re not seeing the photo eyes for the roll case coming on. Alex is working on tracing back the rollcase inputs to see what&#39;s going on. Sam warned us there may be some unusual relays for these inputs.</p>

========================================
<ul>
	<li>Hydraulic oil low, added oil and then knee 2 wouldn&rsquo;t move at all. They had their mill right fix that issue, but then knee 2 wouldn&rsquo;t get on set. It seemed to be overshooting, falling behind the log. I turned on timber bind just to see what would happen and that improved knee 2, but pushed the log away from knee 3 which Joe said was an issue in the past. I tried adjusting the delays to allow the outside dogs to come down before knee 2 came back, but Joe didn&rsquo;t want to risk it. Disabled timber bind and somehow their issue seemed to be fixed entirely. I bet he&rsquo;ll call again.</li>
</ul>
