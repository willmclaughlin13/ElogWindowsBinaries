========================================
<p>Paul called and asked if I could take a look at trying to speed up the system for scanning.&nbsp; He said that it hesitates after pressing the scan button.&nbsp; I looked at the PLC code and the system is waiting&nbsp;for the skew chains to be stopped before scanning.&nbsp; However, the stop bit from the RMC was flickering.&nbsp; To correct this, I increased the Stop Threshold in the RMC for all the chains from .1 in/sec to .75 in/sec.&nbsp; I also had Paul increase the decel rate for the skew chains from 80 to 100.&nbsp; Paul said it was better.</p>

========================================
<p>Tom called saying his knees wouldn&#39;t move unless the carriage was moving. I saw his target position was 78&quot; for all the active knees. Had him cycle control power to get the targets back within bounds. System is showing 10V out of the card, but knees aren&#39;t moving still. Tom is going out to the carriage to measure the voltage coming out of the servo cable while the sawyer holds down limit override.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saw they got it fixed on their own, didn&#39;t call back.</p>

<p>Eric has been having trouble with his emails not sending. I updated their software which didn&rsquo;t help. Found out Google hardened their Gmail. Found a solution that will work for them and everyone else, then shared that solution with the team.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Below is the email I sent to Eric:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been troubleshooting this issue and finally found a good solution.</p>

<p>Google recently hardened their Gmail and no longer allows authenticating with a username and password only from any third-party apps like ours.</p>

<p>The fix for this is a combination of 2-factor authentication as well as an app-password. I just tested this with your current software and my a test Gmail account. After following the steps in the link below, I was able to send emails again. When I generated the app password, I just copied and pasted from google, which excluded the spaces. Here&rsquo;s what mine looked like:</p>

<p>To set this up for you guys, you&rsquo;ll need to re-enable 2-factor authentication and change the password in the Lewis menues (setup options, email setup) to match the app password. From there, everything should work.</p>
