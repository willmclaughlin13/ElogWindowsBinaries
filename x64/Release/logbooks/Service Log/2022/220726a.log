========================================
<p>No communication with the boards. Switch failed on them. He told me this happened recently, and they were expecting a spare from Chris for a long time. Their switches were these ancient cisco switches that connected to AC receptacle. The old switch that failed before is now working. I told him to go out and buy any modern 5-port switch and get rid of these old cisco SD2005 switches</p>

========================================
<p>Micrologix 1400 fault. I walked them through resetting the fault and told them to call us back if it happened again. They told me their slab belt wasn&rsquo;t working. I had them check fuse 110, they had 110V on both sides, fuse is good. They are going to check on the valve make sure there&rsquo;s power out there and that the valve is working</p>

<p>Scott called and and said that their Yoke 1 was higher than Yoke 2 and that Yoke 2 was positioning correctly vertically.&nbsp; I had them use a level to calibrate Yoke 1 lift to Yoke 2 lift.&nbsp; I also helped them correct one of the yokes left\right position.&nbsp; After all that, they said it was taking too much slab on the left.&nbsp; I showed them where to make adjustments to shift the solution left/right in the optimizer software.</p>
