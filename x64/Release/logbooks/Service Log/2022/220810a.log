========================================
<p>Randy called and said their 2 exchange heads are not working.&nbsp; Lasers are not on.&nbsp; They are not on Teamviewer, so I told him to check to see if Setworks still has the S/N for the 2 heads in it.&nbsp; He is going to check and call back if he still needs further help.</p>

<p>They were shutting off the power switch without exiting setworks, losing the new laser serial numbers. Shut down properly, now they work.</p>
