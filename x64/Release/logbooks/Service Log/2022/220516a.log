	<li>Scanners not coming on. I had him trace power to the PoE switch, 48V there. No blue lights on the scanners. Had him turn the scanner power switch on the console and wait 2 seconds. Then it &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t scanning&rdquo;. I had him press the scan button on the handle. I am now the edger troubleshooter</li>
