========================================
<p>Customer said that system would not reference, but encoder screen showed all data correctly (encoder counts, prox switches, etc.) just wouldn&#39;t reference. He zero&#39;ed reference errors on the troubleshooting screen, and then it started working (?). When I remoted on, it was working. Told to call back if the referencing locks up again.</p>

<p>They weren&#39;t referencing. Ended up having a blown D fuse. Replaced it and they were good. I told them to check cable connections for a short if they have issues with that fuse blowing again.</p>
