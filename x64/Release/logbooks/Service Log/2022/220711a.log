========================================
<p>Scott called again and the carriage would not offset the saws after completing the cut on axis 1.&nbsp; I had them adjust End Point Targert Talerance from 1&quot; to 15&quot;.&nbsp; I told him that on longer logs, they may need to adjust that value down to prevent the carriage from hitting the stop bumper.</p>
