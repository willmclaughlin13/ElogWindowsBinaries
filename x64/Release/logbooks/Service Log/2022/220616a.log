========================================
<p>Mill swapped out cylinder, recalibrated everything, and is still getting think boards (1/16 to 1/2) on first boards cut with the slabber. All ofther boards are right on the money. If they turn off slab attached, and just take the opening face slab off with the slabber, come back and cut first board, it&#39;s always nuts on. The other weird thing is, it doesn&#39;t do it all the time. It will run hours without cutting thick boards, then it will, then stop. We need to figure this out.</p>
