========================================
<p>Kurt called after hours saying they couldn&#39;t undog in the unload end to kick a cant. I notices 100+ red encoder errors, only about 5% of total referrences. Checked his drawings and had Kurt check the remote cabinet, no power supply adapter. I taught Kurt and the sawyer how to use limit override to get unstuck in the future. Kurt told me this was the first time it happened where they couldn&#39;t clear it by driving the carriage back and forth, so it&#39;s not a common issue for them. Asked Lewis to send an encoder adapter.</p>

<p>Scans are very slow, taking up to 3 seconds. Offline on TeamViewer. I suggested they clean all their scanners thoroughly with a diluted alcohol solution. They&#39;re working on getting online for me too. Marv suggested I check knee speeds too in case it&#39;s just slow getting on set</p>

<p>Marv found the knees were set to 35&quot;/sec and see signs of a bad accumulator bladder. I asked if Mike had checked on the pressure in his accumulator and he said he hasn&#39;t but he will. Also recommended lubing the knee ways. He will call us back after taking all our advice if the slow scanning persists</p>

========================================
<p>Opening faces are too wide, they measure aroun 6&quot; when they should be 4-5&quot;. We set up their opening face parameters to what they should be, then adjusted their roughness allowence. Happy with their faces now. Next issue is computing after setting puts a shim in their good wood e.g. shim &gt; 4/4 &gt; 4/4 &gt; cant. Daniel and Marv advised nothing we can do about that, they just need to wait longer to compute. He was happy enough with the opening faces</p>

<p>Scott called and asked if I could get on their system to look at their carriage drive positioning.&nbsp; Per Scott, it was over shooting when it would come back to get the next log.&nbsp; I had them adjust the home position in the HMI and that did not help.&nbsp; I had them put the home position back to 12&quot;.&nbsp; I went into the optimizer Carriage Speed Setup and switch all their speeds to 2 except logs over 20&quot; which was set to 1.&nbsp; Scott was happy with the way the machine was running after those changes.</p>

<p>Phill called, they completely shut down the system and when they powered it back up it would not position a board onto the infeed table.&nbsp; I started looking into and before I could find the issue Sam had gotten online with the system.&nbsp; I told Phill to call Sam.&nbsp; Sam called later and told me that he got them fixed.</p>

<p>Scott called back this afternoon about this issue.&nbsp; After looking at the system online and talking with him, I determined it was a scanning issue.&nbsp; I worked with them and recalibrated their scanners and it fixed the issue for them.</p>
