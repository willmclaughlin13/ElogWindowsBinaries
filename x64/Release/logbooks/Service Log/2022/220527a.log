<p>Swapped valves and lubricated, no fix. Told to swap cylinders with Knee 4 over weekend. Could be leaking seal inside cylinder.</p>

<p>Trip called after his TripLite UPS failed this morning. It shutoff completely and wouldn&rsquo;t work, so we know it&rsquo;s not just a bad battery. I sent him a link and info on the APC UPS we recommend.</p>

<p>Ken says his new tempo isn&rsquo;t working correctly. The knee shoots all the way out, then all the way the other direction. He already checked the wires by swapping with another knee. I suggested the magnet may have been dislodged when the tempo got broken off the carriage. He&rsquo;s home for the long weekend, so we couldn&rsquo;t test any ideas.</p>
