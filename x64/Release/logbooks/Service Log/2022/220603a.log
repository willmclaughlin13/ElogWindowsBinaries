========================================
<p>Marv passed this on to me. The cant catcher and slab belt weren&#39;t working with delays. I remapped them correctly and it still wasn&#39;t working, so I made a software update for them. Found the issue in the code, the cant catcher delay doesn&#39;t get used in manual if the auto cant catch bit is on, even if auto is off. I fixed the code to eliminate this issue, and added a job switch to account for pulling up slab belt if down before the delay pulls the cant pins in. The slab belt was also backwards, so I moved it to spare 4 OFF so it would function correctly. I should probably update the other side as well, might do that when Marv is actually onsite next week though. They may need SQL updated. The sawyer info didn&#39;t pull from the database, which usually means it needs an update.</p>
