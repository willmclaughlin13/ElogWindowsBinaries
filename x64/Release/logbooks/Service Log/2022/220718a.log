<p>Firstly, their job name in the jobs folder is Southern LH, which is confusing to say the least</p>

<p>Secondly, linear cant pan chattering. They already swapped the tempo, servo, and cylinder before calling. I turned down their speed from 26&rdquo;/sec to 20&rdquo;/sec which seems to have fixed it</p>
