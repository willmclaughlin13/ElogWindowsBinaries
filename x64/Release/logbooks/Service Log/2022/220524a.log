========================================
<p>Bill said dogs and drop belt wouldn&#39;t work this morning, he cycled power to fix it. It sounded like he had a PLC fault, so I explained how to use the toggle to force stop and flip back to run mode to clear faults. I walked through face adjustments and some other scanning features that he couldn&#39;t remember while talking with him.</p>

========================================
<p>All three knees are moving behind the saw sometimes. First time it happened was yesterday. When the operator returns after a front cut to take another front cut, he changes direction and the band mill offset jumps all the knees back 0.075&rdquo;. He continues down the track and just before he clears the saw, the knees sometimes jump forward several inches. Says he nearly hit the saw with a cant before he manually jogged the knees backwards. Encoder errors look good, so set disable should be working well. No errors or anything, maybe we are within the 4&rdquo; mark. I asked Bill to call me tomorrow when if it happens again and to reboot the cabinet after shift today.</p>
