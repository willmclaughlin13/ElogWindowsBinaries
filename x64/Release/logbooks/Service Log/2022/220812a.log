========================================
<p>After hours. Called about motion stops when they load a log, turns out they&#39;re just runaways out of the cut. The runaway errors on the sawyer&#39;s display show the targets and positions nearly identical but setworks history has the actual position at either the tempo&#39;s offset value or a strange negative number where the numbers after the decimal are also negative.</p>

<p>They had already changed out the position board before calling me, so I suspect it&#39;s a cabling issue. They have two spare tempo cables they&#39;re going to run across after shift today. I increased their out of cut runaway error to get them running a little smoother until we can troubleshoot Monday.</p>

<p>They wanted to set up operator tracking but they have no button for it. I told them I would ask about getting a spare button shipped.</p>

<p>Checking the latest software on the server: they do not have operator tracking turned on. Haven&#39;t been able to check what their software looks like on the system because their Team Viewer wasn&#39;t connecting.&nbsp;They may need a software update.<br />
<br />
In the first call, they said they have a slab attached button that they aren&#39;t using that we could repurpose. Haven&#39;t contacted them back yet.</p>

<p>Operator tracking is not turned on. Asked Tyler to call back when the internet on the system is fixed so we can schedule a software update.</p>

========================================
<p>They called back saying it was chattering again. I guess they swapped the valve and it started again? Not really sure. I cranked the speed down to 6&quot;/sec which John recommended and lowered the inside gain from 1 to 0. Still chattering he said, but much slower. Their old valve is getting rebuilt and sent back to them. I asked them to call me if it&#39;s still chattering after that.</p>

			<p>Firstly, their job name in the jobs folder is Southern LH, which is confusing to say the least</p>

			<p>Secondly, linear cant pan chattering. They already swapped the tempo, servo, and cylinder before calling. I turned down their speed from 26&rdquo;/sec to 20&rdquo;/sec which seems to have fixed it</p>

<p>They might have a bad version of Team Viewer as well. Stuck until next Wednesday when their IT guy gets to fixing their internet connection.</p>

========================================
<p>Erik tells me he&rsquo;s getting INtime errors and he&rsquo;s dropping new logs onto the belt when he goes to load them. He says he needs to reboot the system when it happens. I went through a lot of troubleshooting with Daniel, but we couldn&rsquo;t find a good way to see what&rsquo;s causing the error. I asked Erik to save out his setworks and solution history next time it happens, then to let me know.</p>
