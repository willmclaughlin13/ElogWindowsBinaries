<p>More questions about reports. She told me they interviewed a candidate recently who went through their system during the interview and changed their reports. Said he had previous experience with our system. Sounded like they didn&#39;t hire him anyways. Got what they needed I guess</p>

<p>Wanted me to look into what could cause a wide board with a two board solution to use one picker.&nbsp; Phill said it was rare, but he notices it sometimes on his camera system.</p>

<p>Scheduled an update to their system for Tuesday 8/16</p>

<p>Update includes EW and GW buttons, HMI screen to change these values and a new placement for honing pins.</p>

<p>I changed one of their downtime reasons to &quot;15Not sawing&quot; per Morgan&#39;s request. Seems wild to me as all downtime is &quot;not sawing&quot; and idk why they have the preset number in the names there??</p>

========================================
<p>Spent 2.75 hrs working&nbsp;with Norsie and Scott on their saw calibrations.&nbsp; I think their gradient values are messed up.&nbsp; I had Scott look for the gradient values and he could only find the left saw (Saw 1) and it was 9.1390.&nbsp; The PLC had the left saw as 9.1394 and the right saw as 9.1390.&nbsp; I swapped the gradient values in the PLC.&nbsp; We calibrated the saws.&nbsp; I&#39;m still not sure if the saws are calibrated correctly.&nbsp; The wanted me to help them calibrate Yoke 2 up/down.&nbsp; I told them I couldn&#39;t help at the moment, but they could call back tomorrow.</p>

========================================
<p>They were told to buy a new PLC and called when it arrived to have it installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The issue was an old input from the STOP GATE which was removed years ago coming into the system.&nbsp; This was a manual input, which when&nbsp;MADE causes the system to not allow the automatic routing to occur</p>

<p>Removed stop gate input.&nbsp;</p>
