<p>&quot;We still fitting the same issue with the edger can you get Daniel to look at the histor and see if he sees anything - nathan tried all evening to fix it we replaced the eyes into the saw - it will run a few boards then the pins will stop and And not pull the board over to the table&quot;</p>

<p>I called Tim and he asked if I could look at the history to see if I can see anything.&nbsp; I told him there is no history and we have to trouble shot it live.&nbsp; He called Nathan to see if he could come back to the mill.&nbsp; Tim said that Nathan found a wire that he thinks was causing the issue.&nbsp; Nathan is going back to the mill and will be their in about an 1.5 hours.</p>
