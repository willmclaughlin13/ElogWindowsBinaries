========================================
<p>All three knees are running away. I noticed the load end SE switch was open even though Javier told me he was in the hole, I asked him to drive it further into the hole to make sure that light came on. It did come on, but as he drove the carriage down, I noticed&nbsp; the reading on the tempos started jumping from 30 to 15 to -20. Had them drive the carriage back and forth. The issue is repeatable in the load end, but totally fine in the unload end. I suggested it&#39;s likely the tempo cables on the pantograph arm. As the angle gets more extreme, the issue presents itself. They are going to check the full length of all three cables and call us back.</p>

========================================
<p>Shawn called noticing his opening faces were bad. Went to calibrate and two heads wouldn&#39;t take. Off by 3+ inches. I suggested the scan frame may have been knocked out of alignment. We redid the base calibration which got the opening faces looking good again. Scans were looking good but we were picking up a lot of the knee bunks underneath the log. I told Shawn we like to have the lasers hang 3-4&quot; below the knee bunk and he said his were more like 8-9&quot; on the right side of the carriage and barely extending on the left. They are going to inspect and make sure the scan fram is hanging correctly. I told them to give me a call if they re-adjust it so we can calibrate again.</p>
