<p>Lee called said he was kind of IT. Said the setworks computer&rsquo;s mill network adapter kept going into a &ldquo;disabled state&rdquo;. I made sure he was looking at the right network adapter and suggested he move the usb on the usb adapter, then replace it. Check the network cable.</p>

<p>Lee called me back and showed me the network adapter he was trying to enable. It was our INtime setworks adapter. I asked him to leave that one alone. The issue will be with the USB adapter since it&#39;s not showing up in Windows. Probably just loose. Also I told him there&#39;s way too much saw dust in that cabinet</p>
