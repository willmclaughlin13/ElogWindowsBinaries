========================================
<p>Justin called about some inaccurate lumber lengths. Logs max at 18ft are showing at 20ft. I was seeing dogs in the scanner&nbsp;diagnostics. I told him to try and check the scan frame angle, hopefully that fixes their issue. He&#39;ll call back at some point. Updated firesync client to latest on drive. Fixed their scanning issue.</p>
