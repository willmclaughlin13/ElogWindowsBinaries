<p>Tim called this morning saying that the issue was back on K4.&nbsp; He said that K4 was jittering even when disabled.&nbsp; He also said that he discovered that on the analog board, the lights on K4 were dim and if they pressed on the connector, it would brighten up.&nbsp; He said they don&#39;t have a spare and wanted to know if he could swap the boards between the Remote IO and the Setworks cabinet.&nbsp; I told yes, but he would have to change the address dial on each of the boards.&nbsp; He requested that we ship them a new analog board overnight.</p>

<p>Tim called again, K4 has no voltage.&nbsp; I had them press limit override and the voltage screen showed voltage, however the knee would not move.&nbsp; I had them use the job box on K4 and they still could not get it to move.&nbsp; I had them plug K3 SV cable into the job box while the jog box was connected to K4 and they were able to move K4.&nbsp; I had them move the K4 cable in the Remote IO cabinet to K3 and tested it again with the jog box.&nbsp; It would not move again.&nbsp; I told them they have a bad cable.&nbsp; They requested 2 SV and 2 Temp. cables be sent overnight along with the analog board from earlier.</p>

	<li>More trouble with their scanners. Scan head two came on and the rest of them were off and wouldn&rsquo;t come on. Rebooted the cabinet which fixed the issue. Also, their scan abort delay error was popping up. I increased it from 1.5 to 2.5. Copiah&rsquo;s Lumber Pro delay was 10 seconds</li>
