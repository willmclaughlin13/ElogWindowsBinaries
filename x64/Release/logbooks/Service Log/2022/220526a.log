<p>Logged on to check out their web reports not working. Quickly discovered they are infected with ransomware. Called Kurt who assured me the system is isolated on its own network, but still connected to the internet, so we&rsquo;re confident other computers aren&rsquo;t infected too. I hope he&rsquo;s right. They will swap the brick as soon as they can. When the PC is returned to us, it&rsquo;s imperative that we don&rsquo;t power it on. The hard drive needs to be removed and wiped or better: destroyed.</p>
