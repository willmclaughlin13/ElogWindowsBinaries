========================================
<p>(After hours) Lightning storm corrupted flash drive. I copied over the program from the C which fixed that. Knees wouldn&rsquo;t move. Safety light was coming on. Fuse on output 200 was out, safety light was wired on the left side of the fuse, should be on the right.</p>
