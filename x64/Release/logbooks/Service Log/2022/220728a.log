========================================
<p>I spoke with Jarrod this morning on the phone about the needs for their Edger controls.</p>

<ul>
	<li>He is okay with reusing their existing PLC cabinet, with us replacing the backpanel.</li>
	<li>He does not want a sawyers display or HMI out at the consoles.</li>
	<li>They are changing their edger from a 4 saw system to a 3 saw system.
	<ul>
		<li>This means we can elimate the 4th saw and 3rd picker from the controls.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>He ask for a button that disable saw 3.
	<ul>
		<li>I think we should set it up so that the PLC will move Saw 3 and picker 2 to their edges when the # of saws in the optimizer machine settings is set to 2.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>He asked that we keep the button for disabling positioning Pin # 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>After learning we do still troubleshoot RS1s, I called them back. Johnny was the mill manager but no longer works there. Left a voicemail for the owner to call us back if they&#39;re still having trouble.</p>

========================================
<p>Sawyer was unable to set or jog knees and was getting motion stops. Encoder reference error was -80&rdquo; and setworks history said &ldquo;Ignored sets disabled&rdquo;. Their encoder is connected to their cable spool, but it has some chain and sprocket linkage in between. They said they already went through it looking for slop / slip and tightened the chain. I had them check for a spare encoder and showed the new sawyer how to get around the error when it happens.</p>

<p>Worked with marv to get them sawing correctly. Timber table seemed to be giving them trouble so we copied saved values to species 4 and turned it off for species 1. They seem to be running smoothly now.</p>

<p>They called back to order two new encoders since they didn&#39;t have a spare and asked me to turn off scan set disable for them.</p>
