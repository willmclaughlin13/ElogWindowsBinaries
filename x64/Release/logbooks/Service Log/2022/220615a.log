========================================
<p>Bill says that he doesn&#39;t like having to change his roughness allowance every time he changes a species, plus when he does change it seems like the tally info isn;t going into the right buckets on the reports. Also is still having encoder/pro switch issues with the bandmill offset/backset.</p>

========================================
<p>Saw guide can go up but won&#39;t go down. Daniel told them to check their digital IO board and it seems to be working fine, getting&nbsp;115V when saw guide buttons are pressed. Possibly a mechanical issue with the saw guide.</p>
