<p>Sped up timber bind dog down</p>

<p>Inside gains were 0, I put them back to 3. In-the-cut and out-of-the-cut were both high, I set them to match the RH side</p>

<p>Also sped up jog speed from 15 to 16 in/sec</p>

<p>Inside gain at 3 was overshooting and jittering. I brought it down to 1 and it&#39;s nice and smooth now.</p>

========================================
<p>After hours call. Unforuntately I forgot to write down why they called and can&#39;t remember. I sent Travis a detailed email on changing out a scan head as well as info on our loaner program, so it must have been about a bad scan head. I attached the instructions I sent to Travis and dopped them on the mess that is the migrate folder</p>

<p>I learned the &quot;1 Disabled&quot; message on the sawyer&#39;s display shows up when a single laser is disabled, but I don&#39;t think this shows when it&#39;s just filtered in the log turner menu.</p>
