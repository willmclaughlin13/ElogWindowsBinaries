========================================
<p>Worked with Scott on centering the solution by adjusting their positioner offsets for yoke 1 up/down.&nbsp; Also worked with Scott on adjusting the shift solution right and up to help with the issue.&nbsp; I told Scott, that what really needs to happen is to set the shift right and up to zero and calibrate the system to the center of the dogs.&nbsp; I told him that Chris will need to do this when he is there on-site.</p>
