========================================
<p>Huge encoder reference error -140&rdquo; +- 30&rdquo;, always negative. Before they called, they replaced the cable, the encoder, the hillbilly wheel assembly, and the photo eye. I recalibrated them. Still big errors, encoder count is jumping wildly. Sending new encoder and power supply assembly next day while they are going to try one off their shelf</p>

<p>Pete called asking if we need his computer to have an IP address because they&rsquo;re getting new internet. I confirmed we definitely do need an IP address, we just don&rsquo;t care what it is as long as the PC can get out to the internet.</p>
