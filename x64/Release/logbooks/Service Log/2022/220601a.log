<p>System blew seal on cylinder, they replaced with a spare cylinder, but now they cannot move flitches without holding limit override. Did not get which cylinder it was. Said they did not completely shut machine off to replace cylinder, told to shut everything down, uncluding PLC, and reboot in sequence. If that doesn&#39;t solve, will send Daniel and email for next steps.</p>

========================================
<p>Mike called to recalibrate his system. Still having issues with his front cuts and back cuts being off, but complimentary. E.g. 2.050&rdquo; on one and 1.950 on the second. Marv helped they realize their cinches weren&rsquo;t working and the log was coming forward off the backs of the knees, likely the cinchbacks not working. Mike checked the fuses and said they weren&#39;t blown but they were going to continue troubleshooting. Knee 1 cinch out was missing a wire, I suggested they may be bussed together in the junction box.</p>

<p>ELO touchscreen not working either, likely whole USB hub is not working. Lee won&rsquo;t even open the cabinet while they&rsquo;re sawing, so we&rsquo;ll wait for end of shift to find out. I suggested he directly connect all the USBs into the PC if there&rsquo;s room.</p>

			<p>Lee called me back and showed me the network adapter he was trying to enable. It was our INtime setworks adapter. I asked him to leave that one alone. The issue will be with the USB adapter since it&#39;s not showing up in Windows. Probably just loose. Also I told him there&#39;s way too much saw dust in that cabinet</p>
