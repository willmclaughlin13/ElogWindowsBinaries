========================================
<p>Chris - Bill called and let me log in right after the knees took off on him. Looks like a stuck button or membrane issue where multiple buttons are registering at the same time. Bill will replace the handle with the jog buttons.</p>

			<p>All three knees are moving behind the saw sometimes. First time it happened was yesterday. When the operator returns after a front cut to take another front cut, he changes direction and the band mill offset jumps all the knees back 0.075&rdquo;. He continues down the track and just before he clears the saw, the knees sometimes jump forward several inches. Says he nearly hit the saw with a cant before he manually jogged the knees backwards. Encoder errors look good, so set disable should be working well. No errors or anything, maybe we are within the 4&rdquo; mark. I asked Bill to call me tomorrow when if it happens again and to reboot the cabinet after shift today.</p>
