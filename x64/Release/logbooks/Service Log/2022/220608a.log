<ul>
	<li>Power went out and carriage wouldn&rsquo;t reference. I had him disconnect and reconnect the prox. Switch. It was always on. It started working again either on its own or they &ldquo;flicked it&rdquo; like he said they normally do. I asked Chris to send them two new ones.</li>

========================================
<p>Intermittent slabber issue where 2 inch boards are cutting a quarter inch thicker than they want; other boards seem to be cutting fine.&nbsp;Mike thought it was being caused by the gradient value being entered wrong, and it was fixed for a while after entering the correct value, but the issue returned. We told them to recalibrate their knees and then recalibrate the scanner based on the knees so we could make certain that it wasn&#39;t a calibration issue. Expecting&nbsp;to get a call back this afternoon (12:30 to 1:30 pm)</p>

<p>Corey called, headrig #3 has shallow opening faces on fourth faces. Rs1 system&rsquo;s Bturner out isn&rsquo;t working. I saw on the drawings it was spare 4 for all knees for some reason. I suggested he map a button to spare 4 and try it. Both systems offline on Teamviewer, he&rsquo;s going to call back when he has one online.</p>

<p>Couple scan heads are out. Their system isn&rsquo;t on TeamViewer, they just got new internet and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be online now. They are going to fix it and call back. They also asked about the status of their seal kit order, but we couldn&rsquo;t find that info for them. Hopefully Chris can help when he&rsquo;s back</p>
