<p>Steve says that once a week (not always on the same day) it will fail on the auto report print. Checked shift times, days, and auto print setup, everything looks good. Told him to call back on a day when it doesn&#39;t auto print so we can see what&#39;s going on.</p>

			<p>Corey called, headrig #3 has shallow opening faces on fourth faces. Rs1 system&rsquo;s Bturner out isn&rsquo;t working. I saw on the drawings it was spare 4 for all knees for some reason. I suggested he map a button to spare 4 and try it. Both systems offline on Teamviewer, he&rsquo;s going to call back when he has one online.</p>

<p>Fluffy accidently put a log through the cab, taking out our console. Not sure about handles. Told David to rob console cable from 2nd sysem waiting to be installed to see if it even lights up. If yes, let me know what parts he needs to fix it, if not, send in immediately for repair and use 2nd system&#39;s console in meantime. Must get either 2nd console or loaner back to mill by this weekend to support install ot #2.</p>
