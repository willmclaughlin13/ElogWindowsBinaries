========================================
<p>Swapped the encoder with a third encoder off their shelf and the errors are much better. Calibration is still a little off, but otherwise it&rsquo;s in good shape. I offered to help recalibrate when they&rsquo;re down next</p>

			<p>Huge encoder reference error -140&rdquo; +- 30&rdquo;, always negative. Before they called, they replaced the cable, the encoder, the hillbilly wheel assembly, and the photo eye. I recalibrated them. Still big errors, encoder count is jumping wildly. Sending new encoder and power supply assembly next day while they are going to try one off their shelf</p>

<ul>
	<li>Optimizer PC shutdown randomly. It was able to start again just by pushing the power button. Any hardware failure wouldn&rsquo;t leave it in the shutdown state, it would just restart on its own, so we know it was a software triggered safe shutdown. I suspect it was either Windows update or the UPS glitching. I had him disconnect the USB cable from the UPS and I disabled Windows Updates</li>

	<li>SQL reports appear not to be working. I went back in forth with a lot of employees and found they have been working correctly for the last two shifts. I&rsquo;m thinking the issue may have resolved itself. I&rsquo;ll check back in on them tomorrow morning</li>
