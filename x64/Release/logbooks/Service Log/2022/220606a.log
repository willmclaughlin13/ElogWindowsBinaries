<p>(8:30) Fixed taskbar issue. Ran into issue with their keyboard, it appears that the keyboard&#39;s F1 key is being pressed when the tray is closed we will want to make the tray deeper to avoid this in the future.</p>

<p>Sawyer says that the Bandmill Offset does not work on the 1st and 2nd faces, but does work on 3rd and 4th. Will watch them saw for a while to determine what&#39;s happening.</p>

========================================
<p>Updated their software for the back cut kerf. Mike&rsquo;s going to run a bunch of boards with fancy calipers and calibrate the kerfs as a stop-gap while he waits for his new carriage in a couple months. Helped them recalibrate since it was out of tolerence after they tightened up their hardware over the weekend.</p>

			<p>Mike called to recalibrate his system. Still having issues with his front cuts and back cuts being off, but complimentary. E.g. 2.050&rdquo; on one and 1.950 on the second. Marv helped they realize their cinches weren&rsquo;t working and the log was coming forward off the backs of the knees, likely the cinchbacks not working. Mike checked the fuses and said they weren&#39;t blown but they were going to continue troubleshooting. Knee 1 cinch out was missing a wire, I suggested they may be bussed together in the junction box.</p>
