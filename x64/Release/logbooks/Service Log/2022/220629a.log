========================================
<p>Second call from Tim regarding the knees they had the same issue.</p>

<p>After doing several tests we narrowed the problem down to a problem with the hydraulic system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They found a couple loose wires on there servo valves. They tightened those wires down so at this moment (7:47AM) they are runnng some tests.</p>

<p>They will call back if problem reaccures.</p>

			<p>Tom called saying his knees wouldn&#39;t move unless the carriage was moving. I saw his target position was 78&quot; for all the active knees. Had him cycle control power to get the targets back within bounds. System is showing 10V out of the card, but knees aren&#39;t moving still. Tom is going out to the carriage to measure the voltage coming out of the servo cable while the sawyer holds down limit override.</p>

			<p>Saw they got it fixed on their own, didn&#39;t call back.</p>

<p>Scott called and asked if I could get on their system to look at their carriage drive positioning.&nbsp; Per Scott, it was over shooting the front&nbsp;of the log by about 6&quot;.&nbsp; I had him adjust the home position from 12&quot; to 5&quot; or 6&quot;.&nbsp; He said they would watch it and call back if they need any further help.</p>

<p>The mill called and said that they were having problems with the carriage drive.&nbsp; later Scott got on the phone and said that the control card in Slot 10 had a fault.&nbsp; I got on their system and connected to their PLC.&nbsp; I reset the module and it started working for them.&nbsp; They then said the rotate 90 was not fully rotating.&nbsp; I had them re-reference the actuator and the fixed that problem.</p>

========================================
<p>Scott called again and the carriage would not offset the saws after completing the cut on axis 1.&nbsp; I had them adjust End of Saw Position Target from -50&quot; to -55&quot; and that seamed to fix the issue for them.</p>
